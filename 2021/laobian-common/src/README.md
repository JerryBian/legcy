### Introduction

Shared library for private usage only.

The reason it is created mainly due to:

- A lot of codes are commonly used by differenct projects, such as [blog](https://github.com/JerryBian/laobian-blog), [jarvis](https://github.com/JerryBian/laobian-jarvis).
- .NET global tool can not reference dependency as project, nuget package can solve this issue.

### Platform

This library is built on .Net Standard 2.0, and only support latest frameworks and libraries.

Essentially Windows and Ubuntu are fully tested against, macOS should be green zone too, not guaranteed though.

### Usage

Package Manager

```sh
Install-Package Laobian.Common
```

.NET CLI

```sh
dotnet add package Laobian.Common
```
